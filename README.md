# Jump server passcode workflow for Alfred v2

> For security, one should login jump server before work on product server. Usually we use authorize by dynamic passcode.
After enter ssh command, we need to switch mail application to get passcode.  It's inconvenience. And make me crazy.

This workflow could help you get dynamic passcode convenience. Don't need to switch between the apps any more!
